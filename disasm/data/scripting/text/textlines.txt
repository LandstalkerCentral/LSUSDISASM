0150={CHARNAME}There is a rumor that{LF}Gumi is possessed{LF}by an evil spirit.{EOL}
0151={CHARNAME}I'm all right.{LF}Get those monsters first!!{EOL}
0152={CHARNAME}Oh, Nigel...sigh...{LF}You looked so brave{LF}fighting the Orc Kings...{CLR}
0153={CHARNAME}If only my father's{LF}red jewel were our dowry!{EOL}
0154={CHARNAME}Somebody's gotta put{LF}those Gumi savages in their{LF}place!  If only I were younger....{EOL}
0155={CHARNAME}That's it!  That's the last{LF}straw!!  I'll do it!!{EOL}
0156={CHARNAME}They took Fara{LF}into the shrine.{LF}We tried to go in, but....{CLR}
0157={CHARNAME}the door wouldn't open.{EOL}
0158={CHARNAME}I can see now that I was{LF}wrong....the tribesmen of{LF}Gumi are our brothers.{EOL}
0159={CHARNAME}Be careful what you say....{LF}my husband is enraged!{EOL}

015E={CHARNAME}Have you met anyone who{LF}looks different from us?{YESNO}
015F={CHARNAME}Oh, yeah?{EOL}
0160={CHARNAME}Well, be warned!{CLR}
0161={CHARNAME}They're Gumi tribesmen,{LF}and they don't like us{LF}in Massan.{CLR}
0162={CHARNAME}Don't go south...you'll{LF}get a raw deal!{EOL}

016B={CHARNAME}We're elaborating a{LF}plan, now.  Don't disturb us!{EOL}
016C={CHARNAME}They used something strange{LF}to open that door...{EOL}
016D={CHARNAME}Listen, Nigel!  I wrote a{LF}new song.  It's called{LF}THREE GUYS FROM MASSAN:{CLR}

0172={CHARNAME}I heard it through the{LF}EkeEke vine that Gumi warriors{LF}are often seen around the{CLR}
0173={CHARNAME}bridge these days...at least,{LF}that's what they say.....{EOL}
0174={CHARNAME}He...he rushed out of here{LF}with the guy next door.{LF}He was really enraged!!{EOL}
0175={CHARNAME}Hi, Nigel and Friday!{LF}How have you been?{EOL}
0176={CHARNAME}I've lived here since I was a{LF}child...Massan and Gumi were{LF}very good friends long ago.{CLR}
0177={CHARNAME}What started the feud?{LF}Nobody really...{DELAY_LONG}I know!{CLR}
0178={CHARNAME}Go see the Old Man{LF}at the Waterfall Shrine.{LF}Maybe he can tell you!{EOL}
0179={CHARNAME}It must be an evil curse!{LF}Evil haunts us all...{EOL}
017A={CHARNAME}At last, Massan and Gumi{LF}will attain their former{LF}greatness as sister villages!{EOL}
017B={CHARNAME}You must go see the{LF}Waterfall Shrine Sage.{CLR}

0180={CHARNAME}You're a treasure hunter,{LF}aren'tcha?{CLR}
0181={CHARNAME}Ha, don't even{LF}try to hide it!{LF}I sensed it at once!{CLR}
0182={CHARNAME}Have you met the sage{LF}at the Waterfall Shrine?{YESNO}
0183={CHARNAME}Oh, really?  Huh!{LF}So you're a thief AND a liar!{EOL}

0186={CHARNAME}Oh, the landslide?{LF}Yes, well...we seem to have{LF}run out of luck!{CLR}
0187={CHARNAME}The village was empty, so{LF}I searched for some valuables,{LF}but there was nothing to take.{CLR}
0188={CHARNAME}All I found was{LF}some old statue at the{LF}mayor's house.{CLR}
0189={CHARNAME}There were also some{LF}golds lying around,{LF}but of course I didn't{CLR}
018A={CHARNAME}touch them...{DELAY_LONG}...{DELAY_LONG}NOT!!!{EOL}
018B={CHARNAME}You can't blame me,{LF}can you?{CLR}

018E={CHARNAME}You again!{CLR}
018F={CHARNAME}Me?  Ah, I came here{LF}in search of the treasures,{LF}but grew sleepy....{CLR}
0190={CHARNAME}They say the trees{LF}can be a treasure hunter's{LF}best friend...{CLR}
0191={CHARNAME}I wonder{LF}what that means?.....{EOL}
0192={CHARNAME}What a coincidence!{LF}How are things going?{LF}Me?  Hmmm...so-so!{EOL}
0193={CHARNAME}Hey, young man!{LF}It's me!{CLR}

019E={CHARNAME}On the west side of Gumi,{LF}the road branches off into{LF}two paths at the sea.{CLR}
019F={CHARNAME}The right path leads to the{LF}big town, Mercator.{CLR}
01A0={CHARNAME}The left leads to Ryuma,{LF}which is famous for its{LF}lighthouse.{EOL}
01A1={CHARNAME}They will sacrifice Fara{LF}to their evil gods!{LF}Won't you help?{EOL}
01A2={CHARNAME}Gumi is the village{LF}just south of us.  They're{LF}an atrocious tribe.{EOL}
01A3={CHARNAME}I have to stay here and{LF}defend this village.{LF}It's my responsibility.{EOL}
01A4={CHARNAME}Remember, Nigel...{LF}the straightest path has{LF}many curves.{EOL}
01A5={CHARNAME}Hi!  I can give you a{LF}helpful hint about a{LF}specialty of this island.{CLR}
01A6={CHARNAME}Do you know about it?{YESNO}
01A7={CHARNAME}You do?  Oh.{EOL}
01A8={CHARNAME}It's a restorative called{LF}EkeEke.  It contains a megadose{LF}of the Ekenol vitamin.{CLR}
01A9={CHARNAME}You can buy it anywhere.{LF}Got it?{EOL}
01AA={CHARNAME}Fara was kidnapped because{LF}she's the cutest among us.{LF}Oh, my goodness!{CLR}
01AB={CHARNAME}That means I'm next!{LF}What should I do!{EOL}
01AC={CHARNAME}I heard about your exploits!{LF}I know, I know.  It's all{LF}thanks to EkeEke, right?{EOL}
01AD={CHARNAME}Arf, arf!{EOL}
01AE={CHARNAME}Oh!  You can understand me?{LF}I'm a girl, or...well,{LF}at least I was until{CLR}
01AF={CHARNAME}Helga, a witch in the{LF}woods east of Mercator,{LF}changed me into a dog.{CLR}
01B0={CHARNAME}Marty, my sweetheart, is{LF}also under her spell.  She's{LF}made him into her pet!{CLR}
01B1={CHARNAME}Oh, how my heart longs to{LF}see him...sigh.....but I{LF}can't.  Helga told us{CLR}
01B2={CHARNAME}we can never return to our{LF}human forms if we meet{LF}each other in these figures...{CLR}
01B3={CHARNAME}The curse on us will never{LF}be lifted unless Helga{LF}dies....howoooo!....{EOL}
01B4={CHARNAME}Thank you, thank you!{LF}Marty and I will make this{LF}house our home, now.{EOL}

01B6={CHARNAME}Oh, no!  What's happening?{LF}Marty and I are{LF}changing back again...{CLR}
01B7={CHARNAME}Ha, ha, ha!  Just kidding!{LF}Good luck!{EOL}
01B8={CHARNAME}Cock-cock-a-cock{EOL}
01B9={CHARNAME}Cock-co-co-cock{EOL}
01BA={CHARNAME}If you see something{LF}you want, bring it to the{LF}counter and set it down.{EOL}
01BB={CHARNAME}It's my duty to make{LF}records and perform healings.{LF}What do you want?{CLR}
01BC={CHARNAME}Bring any book to me.{EOL}
01BD={CHARNAME}Is there really a goddess?{EOL}
01BE={CHARNAME}If there really is a{LF}goddess, why did she let them{LF}take Fara?....boo-hoo-hoo!....{EOL}
01BF={CHARNAME}Now I know there's a goddess!{EOL}
01C0={CHARNAME}Take the note and{LF}put it on the counter{LF}if you want to stay.{EOL}
01C1={CHARNAME}Ooooo!  I'm so angry!{LF}Wait'll the mayor hears{LF}about THIS!!{EOL}
01C2={CHARNAME}I've never met such a{LF}courageous man.{LF}I really respect you!{EOL}
01C3={CHARNAME}I'm still studying{LF}the old documents.{LF}Could you give me more time?{EOL}
01C4={CHARNAME}Is it true that Fara{LF}has been kidnapped?{LF}Unbelievable...{CLR}
01C5={CHARNAME}I think the Gumi tribe is{LF}controlled by the Orcs!{LF}Fara must be in danger...{CLR}
01C6={CHARNAME}Go to the Marsh Shrine{LF}and save Fara.{LF}Please hurry, Nigel!{EOL}
01C7={CHARNAME}Good, good...{LF}The two tribes will get close{LF}to each other from now on.{CLR}
01C8={CHARNAME}About King Nole...I just{LF}found out that he did exist{LF}in very ancient times.{CLR}
01C9={CHARNAME}That's all I can find{LF}in my books.  Hopefully, you can{LF}find out more in Mercator.....{EOL}
01CA={CHARNAME}Hmm, lithograph, eh?...{LF}The jewels must belong{LF}to King Nole.{CLR}
01CB={CHARNAME}According to my records,{LF}there are five jewels in all.{LF}If the jewels are real.....{CLR}
01CC={CHARNAME}Interesting...{LF}Come see me again.{EOL}
01CD={CHARNAME}Mercator is a big town.{LF}You'll have fun there, but...{LF}beware of the duke!!...{EOL}
01CE={CHARNAME}What?  You're going off{LF}to defeat Lord Mir?  Hmmmm...{LF}Well, if you must, but....{CLR}
01CF={CHARNAME}I still believe he's innocent.{EOL}
01D0={CHARNAME}Oh, you actually saw{LF}Lord Mir?  Is he all right?...{LF}Great!{CLR}
01D1={CHARNAME}You can fully trust him.{LF}Believe whatever he tells you!{EOL}
01D2={CHARNAME}So, the duke finally{LF}broke his cover...now everyone{LF}will know he's looking for the{CLR}
01D3={CHARNAME}treasures of King Nole.{CLR}
01D4={CHARNAME}Perhaps your coming{LF}here convinced him there was{LF}some truth to the legends{CLR}
01D5={CHARNAME}after all.....{EOL}
01D6={CHARNAME}He has abandoned{LF}the town.{CLR}
01D7={CHARNAME}He would do{LF}anything to find the{LF}legendary treasures.{CLR}
01D8={CHARNAME}Nigel!  Don't let him get{LF}the treasures!  You must{LF}stop his foul ambition!{CLR}
01D9={CHARNAME}If the duke finds those{LF}treasures.....it'll be the{LF}end of the world!{EOL}
01DA={CHARNAME}Who are you?{LF}Get out of here, stranger!{EOL}
01DB={CHARNAME}W-we're sorry.{EOL}
01DC={CHARNAME}Sorry.{LF}Sacred rite.{LF}No visitors allowed!{EOL}
01DD={CHARNAME}Welcome to the{LF}village of Gumi.{EOL}
01DE={CHARNAME}Did you know that we were{LF}controlled by the monsters{LF}they call the Orc Kings?{CLR}
01DF={CHARNAME}Actually, I don't remember{LF}a thing.{EOL}
01E0={CHARNAME}I'm ashamed of myself...{LF}We let the monsters control{LF}us and profane our most{CLR}
01E1={CHARNAME}sacred shrine.  I want to{LF}apologize to Massan, too.{LF}Will they ever forgive us?{EOL}
01E2={CHARNAME}We're going to cooperate{LF}with Massan from now on.{EOL}
01E3={CHARNAME}Thank you!  Thanks.{EOL}
01E4={CHARNAME}Don't be too hard on us.{LF}We're really very sorry.....{EOL}
01E5={CHARNAME}Get out of here!{LF}Get out!{EOL}
01E6={CHARNAME}Was I rude before?  Sorry...{LF}Remember--you'll get ahead{LF}if you put others first.{EOL}
01E7={CHARNAME}They say a witch lives{LF}near Mercator.  I hear she's{LF}very old.{EOL}
01E8={CHARNAME}Go away!{EOL}
01E9={CHARNAME}Mercator?{LF}Exit this village and{LF}head west.{EOL}
01EA={CHARNAME}I can't go to Mercator{LF}because of the landslide.{EOL}
01EB={CHARNAME}The road to Mercator{LF}is open at last!{EOL}
01EC={CHARNAME}Just a minute!{LF}We're the emergency repair{LF}experts.  This'll only take{CLR}
01ED={CHARNAME}a second...{EOL}
01EE={CHARNAME}I'm too tired to speak.{LF}...Oh, yes, of course!{LF}You can go through, now.{EOL}
01EF={CHARNAME}Bow-wow!{EOL}

01F1={CHARNAME}Coooooock...cock...{EOL}
01F2={CHARNAME}I couldn't go to the{LF}shrine with them...{EOL}
01F3={CHARNAME}Is it true that you are{LF}unbelievably strong?{CLR}
01F4={CHARNAME}In that case, stay as{LF}long as you like.{EOL}
01F5={CHARNAME}It's hard to inspire{LF}others to good deeds when{LF}so many evils beset us.....{EOL}
01F6={CHARNAME}They were possessed?...{LF}Oh, my goodness!{EOL}
01F7={CHARNAME}We had a big earthquake{LF}a few days ago.{LF}Natural disasters seem almost{CLR}
01F8={CHARNAME}commonplace nowadays....{EOL}
01F9={CHARNAME}Ahhh...that was refreshing!{LF}Have a nice trip!{EOL}
01FA={CHARNAME}Hi, this is Ryuma.{EOL}
01FB={CHARNAME}Isn't there a hero{LF}somewhere who can{LF}help us...?{EOL}
01FC={CHARNAME}They say you're a{LF}hero, young man!{EOL}
01FD={CHARNAME}I saw some blond beauty{LF}leaving town with{LF}two laughing monsters.....{EOL}
01FE={CHARNAME}We suffer many calamities{LF}these days.  The lighthouse{LF}was vandalized this time.{EOL}
01FF={CHARNAME}I bet I could run those{LF}thieves out of town{DELAY_LONG}.{DELAY_LONG}.{DELAY_LONG}.{LF}if I were older.{EOL}
0200={CHARNAME}Father...{EOL}
0201={CHARNAME}Why did you go{LF}without me?{EOL}
0202={CHARNAME}I know you can get the{LF}{ITEM}, 'cuz I'm going{LF}with you this time!{EOL}
0203={CHARNAME}Ryuma is an old town.{CLR}
0204={CHARNAME}Believe it or not, this town{LF}was much bigger than Mercator{LF}a long, long time ago.{EOL}
0205={CHARNAME}I heard that Mercator is{LF}governed by Duke Mercator now.{EOL}
0206={CHARNAME}Was Duke Mercator{LF}really such a rogue?{EOL}
0207={CHARNAME}You came here to look{LF}for the treasures, too?{CLR}
0208={CHARNAME}If it's true,{LF}I want to have a share.{EOL}
0209={CHARNAME}Don't forget to give me{LF}a share when you find{LF}the treasures!  Ho, ho!{EOL}
020A={CHARNAME}Sales are off this{LF}month because of the thieves!{EOL}
020B={CHARNAME}Leave this place and{LF}go back to your home!!{CLR}
020C={CHARNAME}You won't regret taking{LF}my advice.....{EOL}
020D={CHARNAME}Thank you, Nigel.{LF}You're the town's very own{LF}saviour!{EOL}
020E={CHARNAME}Hello, Nigel.{LF}Seems we just have one{LF}problem after another.{CLR}
020F={CHARNAME}Have you seen the{LF}lighthouse yet?  Nobody can{LF}reach us without the light.{EOL}
0210={CHARNAME}Lately, this is a{LF}dangerous place!  A gang of{LF}thieves has come to this town.{EOL}
0211={CHARNAME}I'm packin' my bags!{LF}Who wants to live with{LF}thieves?{EOL}
0212={CHARNAME}Now that the thieves are{LF}gone, I think I'll stay here{LF}for a while....'Bye now!{EOL}
0213={CHARNAME}Oh, are you a visitor?{LF}We get so few these days{LF}thanks to the thieves.{EOL}
0214={CHARNAME}Horrible!!...{EOL}
0215={CHARNAME}I look forward to{LF}seeing you again.{LF}No, really...I mean it!{EOL}
0216={CHARNAME}The {ITEM} was stolen{LF}by the apprentice of{LF}the lighthouse keeper!{CLR}
0217={CHARNAME}Did you know?{EOL}
0218={CHARNAME}The shop owner has gone.{LF}Where am I supposed to get{LF}herbs and such now?{EOL}
0219={CHARNAME}They're thieves, but{LF}they are still human beings.{LF}I must convert them!{EOL}
021A={CHARNAME}They must be devils!!...{EOL}
021B={CHARNAME}Were they monsters?{LF}Really?{EOL}
021C={CHARNAME}People are unhappy now.{LF}But I'm sure they'll{LF}find happiness someday.{EOL}
021D={CHARNAME}We live in fear of the{LF}thieves who infest the cave{LF}on the promontory.{EOL}
021E={CHARNAME}Please save our town...{EOL}
021F={CHARNAME}You defeated the{LF}thieves all by yourself?{LF}Unbelievable!!{EOL}
0220={CHARNAME}Please restore the light{LF}to our lighthouse soon!!{EOL}
0221={CHARNAME}You've been most helpful{LF}to this town.{EOL}
0222={CHARNAME}They're quick to take flight.{LF}Chickens!!{CLR}
0223={CHARNAME}Mercator soldiers drove them{LF}back to the promontory,{LF}but they escaped.{EOL}
0224={CHARNAME}Won't someone please make{LF}those thieves go away?!{EOL}
0225={CHARNAME}You're great!{LF}How did you ever brave the{LF}depths of that cave alone?{EOL}
0226={CHARNAME}To get the {ITEM} is{LF}almost impossible!  Tell me{LF}who can do it!{EOL}
0227={CHARNAME}What!{LF}You found the {ITEM}!{LF}Incredible!{EOL}
0228={CHARNAME}I thank you from the{LF}bottom of my heart!  When you{LF}find the treasures.....{CLR}
0229={CHARNAME}please buy every item{LF}in the shop!  Ha ha ha ha!{CLR}
022A={CHARNAME}Sorry...just a little{LF}salesman humor!{EOL}
022B={CHARNAME}The people of Mercator{LF}are also troubled by this{LF}business with the lighthouse,{CLR}
022C={CHARNAME}aren't they?{LF}They're saying the Duke{LF}has gone off somewhere...{CLR}
022D={CHARNAME}Do you think he{LF}went to find a{LF}Sun Stone, too?{EOL}

0235={CHARNAME}Ha ha!!  Papa came back!{LF}He's very strong, isn't he?{EOL}
0236={CHARNAME}Don't blame my dad!{CLR}
0237={CHARNAME}He was more shocked than{LF}anybody when that apprentice{LF}guy stole the Sun Stone.{EOL}
0238={CHARNAME}You're way cool!{LF}Next to my dad, you're{LF}the greatest!{EOL}
0239={CHARNAME}Nigel, good timing!  My{LF}apprentice has disappeared{LF}in all this confusion.{CLR}

023B={CHARNAME}Hahahahaha!{LF}Just kidding!  What a{LF}good-natured boy you are!{EOL}
023C={CHARNAME}That's okay!  The people of{LF}Ryuma need your help more{LF}than I do.  You're a good boy!{EOL}
023D={CHARNAME}My runaway assistant{LF}came back suddenly...{CLR}
023E={CHARNAME}and took off with{LF}the {ITEM}....{EOL}
023F={CHARNAME}The master isn't here now,{LF}but maybe I can explain{LF}how it works.{CLR}
0240={CHARNAME}This lighthouse uses a{LF}Sun Stone, the brightest stone{LF}in all the land, to guide ships{CLR}
0241={CHARNAME}safely to the harbor.{EOL}
0242={CHARNAME}M-my...master was{LF}killed by the thieves...{LF}What should I do???{EOL}

0247={CHARNAME}There must be a clue{LF}somewhere in the cave!{EOL}
0248={CHARNAME}You found the lithograph there?{LF}Great!  It must be a clue!{LF}Let me see it!{CLR}
0249={CHARNAME}What?!{LF}It was snatched away?{EOL}
024A={CHARNAME}Duke Mercator abandoned his{LF}town for the treasures...{CLR}
024B={CHARNAME}I guess that means{LF}the legendary treasures{LF}really exist!{EOL}
024C={CHARNAME}Would you mind going out now?{LF}We're in a meeting.{EOL}
024D={CHARNAME}So you heard us...{LF}Well, the mayor went to try to{LF}bargain with the thieves...{CLR}
024E={CHARNAME}but he never came back.{LF}What happened?{EOL}
024F={CHARNAME}You saved the town!{LF}I can't believe you did it{LF}alone!{EOL}
0250={CHARNAME}Greenmaze is also known{LF}as the "Forest of the Lost."{CLR}
0251={CHARNAME}It is said that once you{LF}step into the woods...{DELAY_LONG}...{LF}you never come back out.{CLR}
0252={CHARNAME}It's so dangerous that{LF}Duke Mercator forbids us{LF}to go in.{EOL}
0253={CHARNAME}The mayor is out...{EOL}
0254={CHARNAME}It's all over for this town{LF}if the mayor is killed...{EOL}
0255={CHARNAME}It's unanimous!  You're the{LF}honorary citizen of Ryuma!{EOL}
0256={CHARNAME}What will you do{LF}with the treasures?{EOL}
0257={CHARNAME}Oh, it's our honorary citizen!{LF}We're having a meeting{LF}to decide who's going{CLR}
0258={CHARNAME}to get the {ITEM}.{EOL}
0259={CHARNAME}Go take a look around town,{LF}young man!{EOL}
025A={CHARNAME}Young man, you've caught us{LF}at a bad time.  I don't know{LF}how to put this, but....{CLR}
025B={CHARNAME}we've got a problem.{LF}Would you do us a favor?{YESNO}
025C={CHARNAME}Quick response!{LF}Are you sure?{LF}OK!{CLR}
025D={CHARNAME}Their hideout is in{LF}the cave on the promontory.{LF}You can get there by raft.{EOL}
025E={CHARNAME}You're right,  I should tell you{LF}what I want first.{LF}I want you to go to their{CLR}
025F={CHARNAME}hideout and wipe them out.{LF}Will you do it?{YESNO}
0260={CHARNAME}I'm disappointed in you,{LF}boy...{EOL}
0261={CHARNAME}I knew you were really{LF}something all along!{EOL}
0262={CHARNAME}It's quite difficult, but...{LF}if anyone can solve Greenmaze,{LF}it's you, Nigel.{CLR}
0263={CHARNAME}To get to the Sun Stone,{LF}you'll need a good sense of{LF}balance and excellent{CLR}
0264={CHARNAME}jumping skills.{EOL}
0265={CHARNAME}Aren't you afraid of{LF}thieves?  Go home!{EOL}
0266={CHARNAME}I'm hiding 'cause{LF}I'm afraid of the thieves.{EOL}
0267={CHARNAME}I'm still frightened...{LF}Are they gone yet?{EOL}
0268={CHARNAME}Another betrayal!{LF}I can't trust anyone anymore!{EOL}
0269={CHARNAME}Bow-wow!{EOL}
026A={CHARNAME}Hmmmmm...I live here because{LF}I love the tang of the sea.{EOL}
026B={CHARNAME}You can get into Mercator{LF}with the {ITEM}.{EOL}
026C={CHARNAME}I think we need{LF}an exorcism or something.{EOL}
026D={CHARNAME}It's strange...{LF}Where is the mayor?{LF}What's happening to this town?{EOL}
026E={CHARNAME}What on earth{LF}do those thieves want?{EOL}
026F={CHARNAME}A strange blond woman just{LF}snatched my safe-conduct pass!{EOL}
0270={CHARNAME}If ya ain't got a{LF}safe-conduct pass, ya ain't{LF}gettin' in these gates!{EOL}
0271={CHARNAME}This is Mercator, where{LF}money's the most important{LF}thing in the world!{EOL}
0272={CHARNAME}Heheheh....{LF}Sorry 'bout that.  I'll make{LF}it up to you someday.{EOL}
0273={CHARNAME}My legs are sore from{LF}standing here all day long.{EOL}
0274={CHARNAME}Mercator is a historic town.{LF}We welcome you.{EOL}
0275={CHARNAME}Hello, Nigel!{LF}How you doing?{EOL}
0276={CHARNAME}Mercator is a{LF}beautiful town, great for{LF}sightseeing and entertainment.{EOL}
0277={CHARNAME}I've just arrived from the{LF}continent.  Gosh, what{LF}a big town!{EOL}
0278={CHARNAME}I heard that Madame{LF}Yard's is a great place to{LF}rid oneself of stress!{EOL}
0279={CHARNAME}Wowie!!  Mercator is{LF}wonderful!  I LIKE it!{LF}I want to stay here forever!{EOL}
027A={CHARNAME}The prices are way too high{LF}in this town.  I'm gonna need{LF}a lot more money...{EOL}
027B={CHARNAME}You're new in town, right?{EOL}
027C={CHARNAME}I spent all my money!{LF}I have to go home, but I can't{LF}afford the trip back!{EOL}
027D={CHARNAME}This young fool was the{LF}lighthouse keeper's assistant.{LF}His master fully trusted him,{CLR}
027E={CHARNAME}but he stole the {ITEM}!{LF}He betrayed his master!{EOL}
027F={CHARNAME}Young men nowadays lack{LF}grit!  They are always taking{LF}the short view of things!{EOL}
0280={CHARNAME}We are discussing{LF}the future of Mercator.{EOL}
0281={CHARNAME}I can't believe it!  I spent{LF}over 1000 golds on that{LF}stupid chicken race!!{EOL}
0282={CHARNAME}We almost never get to{LF}go inside the castle...{EOL}
0283={CHARNAME}The duke is now receiving{LF}applications for mercenaries.{EOL}
0284={CHARNAME}YOU were invited to the{LF}castle?  You must be strong!{LF}Can I have your autograph?{EOL}
0285={CHARNAME}No, no, don't disturb me!{LF}This requires my utmost{LF}concentration...{EOL}
0286={CHARNAME}What's wrong with you?{LF}Go ahead!  Just open the{LF}door and go in!{EOL}
0287={CHARNAME}How was it?  Not quite{LF}what you thought, was it?{EOL}
0288={CHARNAME}I said, do not disturb me!{LF}Hammana, hammena, hammina...{EOL}
0289={CHARNAME}The {ITEM}!{LF}I can see it!{LF}Now go and get it!{CLR}
028A={CHARNAME}Then the lighthouse{LF}will be restored!{CLR}
028B={CHARNAME}I think you're smart{LF}enough to get through{LF}Greenmaze on your own.{EOL}
028C={CHARNAME}You got the {ITEM}!{LF}My crystal ball never lies....{EOL}
028D={CHARNAME}Please don't disturb{LF}me, or I will be forced to{LF}turn you into a dog!!{CLR}
028E={CHARNAME}Now, where was I?.....{EOL}
028F={CHARNAME}I want to be young again.....{EOL}
0290={CHARNAME}Hi, cutie!{LF}Am I pretty?{LF}Am I young? La-la-la!{EOL}
0291={CHARNAME}If my mom really becomes{LF}young, I can boast to all my{LF}friends!{EOL}
0292={CHARNAME}I'm happy to see my mom{LF}young again, but...{EOL}
0293={CHARNAME}Monsters on this island{LF}are rare.  They fetch a{LF}good price on the continent.{EOL}
0294={CHARNAME}I got a ton of golds for{LF}the monsters!  I'm going to{LF}Greenpea's Playhouse.{EOL}
0295={CHARNAME}I caught the three most{LF}wanted criminals on this{LF}island!  They'll bring in{CLR}
0296={CHARNAME}a good price!{EOL}

0298={CHARNAME}....whoooOOOOoooo!!!......{EOL}
0299={CHARNAME}YAAARRRG!!.....{EOL}
029A={CHARNAME}Hissssss!!!.....{EOL}
029B={CHARNAME}Duke Mercator is a man of{LF}fine character.  This{LF}comfortable life we lead{CLR}
029C={CHARNAME}is all because of him.{LF}Hurrah for Duke Mercator!{EOL}
029D={CHARNAME}W-wh-what?{LF}Duke Mercator deserted us?{LF}I don't believe it!{EOL}
029E={CHARNAME}Hurrah for General Arthur!{EOL}
029F={CHARNAME}I heard that an evil magician{LF}to the south of us is a source{LF}of great distress to the Duke.{CLR}
02A0={CHARNAME}He must be using his magic{LF}powers to threaten the Duke{LF}into giving him money.{CLR}
02A1={CHARNAME}That's why we have to{LF}pay a heavy tax...isn't it?{EOL}
02A2={CHARNAME}Did you defeat Mir?  Really?{LF}Then why the long face?{EOL}
02A3={CHARNAME}Where will we be{LF}without Duke Mercator?{EOL}
02A4={CHARNAME}General Arthur lowered{LF}the tax rate.{LF}He's quite a guy!{EOL}
02A5={CHARNAME}Welcome to Mr. Ludwig's.{LF}If you came for a{LF}music lesson,{CLR}
02A6={CHARNAME}Mr. Ludwig is out.....{EOL}
02A7={CHARNAME}Ludwig is not here!{LF}I'm afraid It'll be some time{LF}before he returns.{EOL}
02A8={CHARNAME}Did you come here to listen{LF}to him play, too?  I came{LF}all the way from the continent{CLR}
02A9={CHARNAME}just to hear our very own{LF}national treasure play...{LF}where is he?{EOL}
02AA={CHARNAME}What a pity!  I was looking{LF}forward to listening to that{LF}beautiful sound of his.{EOL}
02AB={CHARNAME}I'm going back to the{LF}continent.  There's no sense{LF}in waiting any longer{CLR}
02AC={CHARNAME}for this Ludwig character.{LF}What?  The lighthouse is{LF}out of order?{CLR}
02AD={CHARNAME}Gee!{LF}Of all the rotten luck!!!{EOL}
02AE={CHARNAME}I'm going back home.{LF}Looks like I'll never get to{LF}hear him play, now.{EOL}
02AF={CHARNAME}Hurry, hurry!!{LF}Step right up!{LF}We're almost out of stock!{EOL}
02B0={CHARNAME}There's none cheaper!{LF}Low-price guarantee...{LF}...every day!!{EOL}
02B1={CHARNAME}This shop is famous{LF}even on the continent.  I have{LF}a huge shopping list for{CLR}
02B2={CHARNAME}all my friends.....{EOL}
02B3={CHARNAME}This shop is always crowded{LF}because it's cheaper than{LF}that other shop over there.{EOL}
02B4={CHARNAME}What a fool!{LF}I bought too many!{EOL}
02B5={CHARNAME}If you're not a registered{LF}member, don't waste my time.{LF}Scram!  Beat it!!{EOL}
02B6={CHARNAME}You again!{LF}I said members only!{LF}Now, out!  Out!{EOL}
02B7={CHARNAME}Please...go on upstairs.{EOL}
02B8={CHARNAME}What a stubborn kid!{LF}Do you want to make me angry?{LF}Get out of here!{EOL}
02B9={CHARNAME}You're too young for{LF}Madame Yard's.  I'm sorry.{CLR}
02BA={CHARNAME}Please come again{LF}when you've grown up.{EOL}
02BB={CHARNAME}Curious boy!{LF}You know, curiosity is a{LF}necessity for greatness.....{EOL}
02BC={CHARNAME}Hello, kind sir.  To become{LF}a member at Madame Yard's,{LF}please ask at the counter.{EOL}
02BD={CHARNAME}Say hello to Miss Shorty--{LF}er, I mean, Miss Friday!{EOL}
02BE={CHARNAME}Non-members can't{LF}go upstairs.  Sorry.{EOL}
02BF={CHARNAME}OK, listen carefully.{LF}This is a popular trick{LF}among the young boys...{CLR}
02C0={CHARNAME}Go and see the Fortuneteller.{LF}I'm sure you'll be{LF}pleasantly surprised!{EOL}
02C1={CHARNAME}Welcome to Madame Yard's!{LF}She's the very best!!{EOL}
02C2={CHARNAME}Hardships are essential{LF}for you to mature.{CLR}
02C3={CHARNAME}There really are no{LF}easy solutions.....{EOL}
02C4={CHARNAME}Quite expensive, but I feel{LF}much better!  I've got to go{LF}home now and...{CLR}
02C5={CHARNAME}practice what I learned...{EOL}
02C6={CHARNAME}Duke Mercator asked him{LF}to steal the {ITEM} for{LF}six golds!  Six!!{EOL}
02C7={CHARNAME}I've just about dislocated{LF}my jaw from talking so much.{EOL}
02C8={CHARNAME}I want them to lower{LF}our taxes!{EOL}
02C9={CHARNAME}My favorite game is{LF}roulette!  Let's go win{LF}a bundle on it!{EOL}
02CA={CHARNAME}Me?  Yes, I'm a{LF}member, but I don't wear{LF}my tutu when I'm off.{EOL}
02CB={CHARNAME}I've been waiting all week{LF}for a session with{LF}Madame Yard!{CLR}
02CC={CHARNAME}If only I could afford to{LF}come here more often.....{EOL}
02CD={CHARNAME}...sigh....The shop is{LF}closed now.  But you can{LF}see that.....{CLR}
02CE={CHARNAME}As you know, there's another{LF}shop just across the way.{LF}Both of us sell{CLR}
02CF={CHARNAME}the same items, but they{LF}sell them much cheaper.{LF}I'm thinking of changing{CLR}
02D0={CHARNAME}my job, but I don't know what{LF}kind of shop I'd be most{LF}suitable for.....{CLR}
02D1={CHARNAME}I don't even want to{LF}get out of bed, I'm{LF}such a failure!.....{EOL}
02D2={CHARNAME}I want to open a new shop...{LF}...sigh...what should I do?...{EOL}
02D3={CHARNAME}Nigel, how have you been?{LF}I've been thinking hard about{LF}starting over,{CLR}
02D4={CHARNAME}making a new life....and I{LF}finally made up my mind{LF}to change my job!{CLR}
02D5={CHARNAME}Would you give me{LF}your opinion?{YESNO}
02D6={CHARNAME}Yeah, I know that you're{LF}busy.  Visit me later when{LF}you have nothing better to do.{EOL}
02D7={CHARNAME}How about a drugstore?{YESNO}
02D8={CHARNAME}Hmmm....okay, then,{LF}how about a variety shop?{YESNO}
02D9={CHARNAME}Well, I've got the list of{LF}possibilities narrowed down{LF}to these two.  So......{CLR}
02DA={CHARNAME}choose between the two.{LF}I'll follow your advice.{CLR}
02DB={CHARNAME}Now, let's try once more.{CLR}
02DC={CHARNAME}You agree?  Great!!{LF}It looks like I'm a drugstore{LF}owner from now on!{CLR}
02DD={CHARNAME}You agree?  Then it's{LF}settled!  I'm a variety shop{LF}owner from now on!{CLR}
02DE={CHARNAME}By the way, would you{LF}do me a favor?{LF}I'd like you to go to the{CLR}
02DF={CHARNAME}wholesale market at the{LF}Mercator port warehouse.{LF}It opens when the ship from{CLR}
02E0={CHARNAME}the continent docks here.{LF}Please go to the market and{LF}pick up the goods for me.{CLR}
02E1={CHARNAME}I'll stay here and fix things{LF}up.  Bring this with you.{LF}It's a Buyers' Guild card.{CLR}
02E2={CHARNAME}Did you go to the market?{EOL}
02E3={CHARNAME}I received the goods, and I'm{LF}doing quite well these days!{CLR}
02E4={CHARNAME}I'm happy with my new{LF}shop!  This is the turning{LF}point of my life!{CLR}
02E5={CHARNAME}I owe it all to you, Nigel!{CLR}
02E6={CHARNAME}In return, I'd like to offer you{LF}my bargain basement prices!{CLR}
02E7={CHARNAME}Drop by anytime!{EOL}
02E8={CHARNAME}We have a large stock{LF}of unusual things!{EOL}
02E9={CHARNAME}Was the market already{LF}closed?  That's okay.{LF}They'll open it up again.{CLR}
02EA={CHARNAME}I'll just stay here and{LF}get things ready so I can{LF}go for myself next month.{EOL}
02EB={CHARNAME}Dad should have checked{LF}around town before{LF}opening this shop...{EOL}
02EC={CHARNAME}My dad is thinking of{LF}changing his job.{EOL}
02ED={CHARNAME}I'm a drugstore owner's son{LF}from now on!  Wow!{EOL}
02EE={CHARNAME}I'm a variety shop owner's{LF}son from now on! Wow!{EOL}
02EF={CHARNAME}My dad is a great shopkeeper.{LF}I love him.{EOL}
02F0={CHARNAME}How do you do?  I'm June,{LF}Fahl's fair girlfriend.{EOL}
02F1={CHARNAME}It's quite embarrassing!  My son{LF}goes to Madame.....Lard's{LF}or something almost everyday!{CLR}
02F2={CHARNAME}I just can't understand him!{LF}Is it such a great place?{EOL}
02F3={CHARNAME}Mir lives in that old tower,{LF}but I hear he was in town{LF}long before the duke.{CLR}
02F4={CHARNAME}Apparently, the duke expelled{LF}him from Mercator because of{LF}some hideous crime.....{EOL}
02F5={CHARNAME}Mir lives in that old tower,{LF}but I hear he was in town{LF}long before the duke.{CLR}
02F6={CHARNAME}Apparently, the duke expelled him{LF}frome Mercator because of{LF}some hideous crime.....{CLR}
02F7={CHARNAME}Oh, I don't know if it's{LF}true or not.  I just{LF}heard it from a friend.{CLR}
02F8={CHARNAME}The {ITEM} is a{LF}precious ore.  It's only found{LF}in the depths of Greenmaze.{EOL}
02F9={CHARNAME}I haven't heard a thing{YESNO}rom my relatives in Verla{LF}for a while, now.....{EOL}
02FA={CHARNAME}I heard that Duke Mercator{LF}brought nothing but trouble{LF}to Verla as well.{EOL}
02FB={CHARNAME}If General Arthur had been{LF}killed, Mercator would be{LF}a ghost town, now!{EOL}
02FC={CHARNAME}I disagree with him.{LF}I think Madame Yard's{LF}is a nice place.{EOL}
02FD={CHARNAME}It's impossible to enter{LF}Mir's tower because of{LF}the barrier at the door...{EOL}
02FE={CHARNAME}...Oh, it's you...{EOL}
02FF={CHARNAME}Greenmaze is to the north{LF}of the castle.  Many tourists{LF}are reported missing there{CLR}
0300={CHARNAME}each year, so the duke{LF}prohibited all entry{LF}into Greenmaze.{EOL}
0301={CHARNAME}Duke Mercator is crazy with{LF}greed over those treasures.{LF}Are they really so valuable?{EOL}
0302={CHARNAME}I'm quite satisfied with{LF}General Arthur's{LF}administration.{EOL}
0303={CHARNAME}I saw a great beauty{LF}walking along the street.{LF}Her two attendants were...{CLR}
0304={CHARNAME}....can you guess?{LF}They were monsters!{EOL}
0305={CHARNAME}Are you going to defeat{LF}the magician in the tower?{EOL}
0306={CHARNAME}Wow!{LF}You came back alive!{EOL}
0307={CHARNAME}But the lighthouse cannot{LF}exist without the {ITEM}!{LF}Who would do such a thing?{EOL}
0308={CHARNAME}If the tunnel between Verla{LF}and Mercator could be{LF}re-opened, Verla would be just{CLR}
0309={CHARNAME}a step away.  But a recent{LF}earthquake blocked up the{LF}tunnel.  So you can only{CLR}
030A={CHARNAME}get to Verla by sea, now.....{EOL}
030B={CHARNAME}One of my relatives{LF}runs a shop in Verla.{EOL}
030C={CHARNAME}General Arthur struggled{LF}with the Duke to the last.{EOL}
030D={CHARNAME}Would you like a fruit drink?{LF}How about my Dahl Delight?{CLR}
030E={CHARNAME}It's the choice of a{LF}new generation!{EOL}
030F={CHARNAME}Duke Mercator is now{LF}recruiting mercenaries to{LF}mount an attack against Mir.{CLR}
0310={CHARNAME}They're having a victory{LF}celebration in advance.{EOL}
0311={CHARNAME}Nigel!{LF}Is it true you defeated Mir?{EOL}
0312={CHARNAME}Duke Mercator ran out on{LF}the town!  What a surprise!{CLR}
0313={CHARNAME}What are we going to do{LF}now?{EOL}
0314={CHARNAME}I've remodeled!{LF}You can order from upstairs{LF}and not even get out of bed!{CLR}
0315={CHARNAME}Go upstairs and{LF}order something.{EOL}
0316={CHARNAME}Where is she?...sigh!...{LF}...where is she now...{LF}oh!  Are you a tourist?{CLR}
0317={CHARNAME}Will you hear my story?{YESNO}
0318={CHARNAME}Needless to say, I'm Ludwig,{LF}the world-famous composer{LF}from the continent.{CLR}
0319={CHARNAME}Princess Lara came here{LF}to study under me, but then...{CLR}
031A={CHARNAME}she just vanished!!{LF}I'm afraid my lessons weren't{LF}good enough for her...{CLR}
031B={CHARNAME}She might at least say{LF}good-bye before leaving...{LF}Sigh!...how cute she was....{EOL}
031C={CHARNAME}Oh, please listen....{YESNO}
031D={CHARNAME}I felt a bit sick, so I{LF}came out here.  Princess{LF}Lara?  Well, she's...{CLR}
031E={CHARNAME}Particular...yes, particular!{LF}Actually, she's{LF}very hard to deal with.{CLR}
031F={CHARNAME}Perhaps her fussiness{LF}irritated the Duke so much{LF}he sent her back home.....{EOL}
0320={CHARNAME}That Ludwig is a bit of a sap!{LF}I think he's out of his head{LF}over this princess babe....{EOL}
0321={CHARNAME}Ludwig?  After returning{LF}from the castle, he guzzled{CLR}
0322={CHARNAME}six Diet Dahls.  Six!  Then{LF}he became unruly, so I{LF}had to throw him out.{EOL}
0323={CHARNAME}How sensitive that Ludwig is!{LF}He seemed so shocked when{LF}I asked him to leave.{CLR}
0324={CHARNAME}Now he's gone off{LF}somewhere, probably to{LF}lick his wounds.....{CLR}
0325={CHARNAME}These artist types sure{LF}are hard to understand.{EOL}
0326={CHARNAME}General Arthur's alive!{LF}Happy, happy!  Joy!  Joy!{LF}Let's party!{EOL}
0327={CHARNAME}Huzzah!  Huzzah!  Let's hear{LF}it for lower taxes!  Look out,{LF}Mir, I'm comin' to getcha!{EOL}
0328={CHARNAME}TOGA!  TOGA!  TOGA!{LF}Hey, you!  Barkeep!  Another{LF}round of Dahl Delights!{CLR}
0329={CHARNAME}Are the taxes lowered yet?{LF}Did they get that Mir guy?{LF}Who cares?  Let's party!!{EOL}
032A={CHARNAME}Have you been to the{LF}casino yet?  It's exciting!{EOL}
032B={CHARNAME}The men in this town{LF}seem to be falling{LF}head over heels{CLR}
032C={CHARNAME}for some new cutie{LF}from the continent.....{EOL}
032D={CHARNAME}Welcome back, hero!{LF}...but...why so troubled?{LF}Anything wrong?{EOL}
032E={CHARNAME}Is the rumor about the{LF}Duke true?  If so, he must{LF}really be a wicked man!{CLR}
032F={CHARNAME}He was always smiling and{LF}pretending to serve the town.{EOL}
0330={CHARNAME}General Arthur and his{LF}new casino are the{LF}talk of the town now.{EOL}
0331={CHARNAME}Take it from me, kid!{LF}Never, never, NEVER give{LF}your heart to a girl!!{EOL}
0332={CHARNAME}Ah, Princess......{LF}Zzzzzzzz.....{EOL}
0333={CHARNAME}I...feel sick...{LF}to my stomach......{EOL}
0334={CHARNAME}Not only do I feel sick{LF}to my stomach, I think{LF}I sprained my ankle.....!{EOL}
0335={CHARNAME}Zzzzz...{LF}Julie.....{EOL}
0336={CHARNAME}Duke Mercator is originally{LF}from the continent, so he{LF}often invites guests from his{CLR}
0337={CHARNAME}homeland.  Just recently, a{LF}noble girl named Lara came{CLR}
0338={CHARNAME}to study piano.  I haven't{LF}seen her around, lately, so{LF}maybe she went home.....{EOL}
0339={CHARNAME}I heard about you!  You're{LF}one of those mercenary{LF}fellas who're going off to{CLR}
033A={CHARNAME}defeat Mir and restore the{LF}peace!  We're expecting much{LF}from you!  Waste that wizard!{EOL}
033B={CHARNAME}Hey, hero!  How'd the{LF}fight against Mir go?{LF}Are you OK?{EOL}
033C={CHARNAME}If the terrible rumor{LF}about the Duke is true, it{LF}must be a lie that it was Mir{CLR}
033D={CHARNAME}who caused the heavy tax.{EOL}
033E={CHARNAME}Our family has been serving{LF}the castle for generations.{LF}Now my son is a cook, and{CLR}
033F={CHARNAME}my daughter is a maid.{LF}They work for Duke Mercator.{LF}You envy them, right?{EOL}
0340={CHARNAME}My son told me that{LF}you're going to the tower.{LF}They say the tower{CLR}
0341={CHARNAME}is full of traps and snares.{LF}Please be careful!....{EOL}
0342={CHARNAME}Oh, Nigel!{LF}You came back from the tower!{LF}Amazing!{EOL}
0343={CHARNAME}What a fool!{CLR}
0344={CHARNAME}Do you know the{LF}importance of the{LF}{ITEM}?{CLR}
0345={CHARNAME}Go to Greenmaze and{LF}find the {ITEM}{LF}by yourself!{EOL}
0346={CHARNAME}Finally he's seen the light!{LF}We've been preaching to him{LF}for six hours!{EOL}
0347={CHARNAME}Have you heard about{LF}General Arthur?{YESNO}
0348={CHARNAME}He's in charge of the{LF}castle guard, now.  He's still{LF}worried about the Duke's plot.{CLR}

03C2={CHARNAME}We are the first{LF}kid-gatekeepers of{LF}this castle.{EOL}
03C3={CHARNAME}Co-cock-o-o-oooo...{EOL}
03C4={CHARNAME}Why do men act like fools{LF}when they fall in love?!{EOL}
03C5={CHARNAME}I made my fortune here,{LF}so I'm going back to{LF}the continent.{EOL}
03C6={CHARNAME}What bad timing!{LF}I'm all ready, but the{LF}ship can't leave!...{EOL}

03E2={CHARNAME}I think General Arthur{LF}will make a great ruler!{EOL}
03E3={CHARNAME}Do you think those who{LF}buy 100 EkeEke at a time{LF}are stupid?  So do I!{EOL}
03E4={CHARNAME}Gambling is like a drug!{LF}Once you get started, you{LF}can never get enough!...{EOL}
03E5={CHARNAME}Greenpea is the name{LF}of the owner here.{EOL}
03E6={CHARNAME}I'm the ship's captain.  I'm{LF}just like anyone else on land,{LF}but on the sea, I'm king!...{EOL}

041E={CHARNAME}The paintings and ornaments{LF}in this castle are{LF}well known for their{CLR}
041F={CHARNAME}historic value.  Incidentally,{LF}this picture is by the famous{LF}Van Dough.  If you{CLR}
0420={CHARNAME}really want it, I'm sure{LF}the duke would sell it to you.{LF}Only 50,000 golds...cheap!{EOL}
0421={CHARNAME}Collecting art{LF}is the duke's hobby.{EOL}
0422={CHARNAME}What a surprise!{LF}Mr. Zak, the Dragonute, said{LF}that he would buy this one!{CLR}

0426={CHARNAME}Mr. Dexter?  No, I don't{LF}know where he is now{LF}He was gone by the time I{CLR}
0427={CHARNAME}came to clean his room.....{EOL}
0428={CHARNAME}That's your maid over there.{LF}She'll show you to your room.{EOL}
0429={CHARNAME}An evil magician is{LF}tormenting Duke Mercator.{LF}The duke has been avoiding{CLR}
042A={CHARNAME}a direct confrontation{LF}out of consideration for the{LF}townspeople, but...{CLR}
042B={CHARNAME}you'll hear more about it{LF}at the dinner party.{CLR}
042C={CHARNAME}You need some rest now.{EOL}
042D={CHARNAME}There is a barrier at{LF}the door to Mir's tower.{LF}I think General Arthur{CLR}

0432={CHARNAME}Yes, you are!{LF}A veteran bounty hunter can{LF}easily tell his fellow thief!{CLR}

0434={CHARNAME}This gorgeous castle is{LF}well worth exploring.....{EOL}
0435={CHARNAME}A dinner party!{LF}Do they serve any of my{LF}favorites, like raw meat?{EOL}
0436={CHARNAME}You may tag along{LF}behind me tomorrow{LF}if you want.{CLR}
0437={CHARNAME}It must be kind of a{LF}burden to be so puny!{EOL}
0438={CHARNAME}Duke Mercator was a{LF}famous swordsman in Gamoor.{LF}I look up to him.{EOL}
0439={CHARNAME}To be invited by the duke{LF}is a great honor!  I waited{LF}over 20 years to get{CLR}
043A={CHARNAME}this chance...but you look{LF}very young!  How old are you?{EOL}
043B={CHARNAME}I would give my life to be{LF}of any service to him!{EOL}
043C={CHARNAME}I'm proud of my job!{EOL}
043D={CHARNAME}Mr. Nigel, would you{LF}please go to the banquet room?{EOL}
043E={CHARNAME}I'm proud of my job!{EOL}
043F={CHARNAME}Good morning, Mr. Nigel!{EOL}
0440={CHARNAME}We have to take care of{LF}VIPs everyday. It sometimes{LF}wears my nerves thin.{EOL}
0441={CHARNAME}Have fun at the party!{EOL}
0442={CHARNAME}We have to take care of{LF}VIPs everyday.  It can really{LF}frazzle my nerves...{EOL}
0443={CHARNAME}Mr. Zak and Mr. Dexter{LF}took off early this morning.{EOL}
0444={CHARNAME}I'm sorry, but we're busy{LF}preparing for the party now.{EOL}
0445={CHARNAME}Everyone is waiting.{LF}Please come in.{EOL}
0446={CHARNAME}I'm sorry, but Duke Mercator{LF}has gone to bed.  He's not{LF}feeling very well tonight...{EOL}
0447={CHARNAME}Mr. Zak left{LF}quite a while back.....{EOL}
0448={CHARNAME}Arf, arf...{EOL}
0449={CHARNAME}Bow-wow!{EOL}
044A={CHARNAME}I'm a member of the duke's{LF}Royal Guard.  I'm guarding{LF}the duke with my life!{EOL}
044B={CHARNAME}The duke is a gentleman,{LF}but a little nervous.{EOL}
044C={CHARNAME}It is said that nobody{LF}ever left that tower alive.{LF}Please be careful!{EOL}
044D={CHARNAME}I'm the duke's maid.{LF}If you need anything, please{LF}call one of the other maids.{EOL}
044E={CHARNAME}It's time for the dinner{LF}party.  The banquet room is{LF}on the second floor.{EOL}
044F={CHARNAME}Duke Mercator is{LF}out now.{EOL}
0450={CHARNAME}This is the library.{LF}I'm happiest when I'm{LF}surrounded by a lot of books.{EOL}
0451={CHARNAME}It's almost impossible{LF}to get into Mir's tower.{LF}That barrier cannot be broken.{EOL}
0452={CHARNAME}I was surprised to see{LF}two horrible monsters{LF}following some great beauty {CLR}
0453={CHARNAME}out of the basement!{LF}Who were they?  And{LF}what were they doing there?{EOL}
0454={CHARNAME}Hey boy!  Are you a rookie?{LF}We have a banquet tonight,{LF}so shake a leg!{CLR}
0455={CHARNAME}Oh!...are you a guest?{LF}Oops!...er, um...{LF}...excuse me, sir!{EOL}
0456={CHARNAME}I'm worn out!{LF}Catering a banquet is no{LF}picnic!{EOL}
0457={CHARNAME}Hiccup!...wooops...{LF}Er, this cooking sherry needs{LF}more salt!...hiccup!...{EOL}
0458={CHARNAME}How selfish she is!{LF}She told me, "I'm on a diet.{LF}Serve me a special menu{CLR}
0459={CHARNAME}with no meat, no fish!"{LF}I really don't like her!  But{LF}a guest is a guest...{EOL}
045A={CHARNAME}I don't like her!{LF}She leaves the room untidy,{LF}and her bathroom's always{CLR}
045B={CHARNAME}sloppy!  I've never{LF}seen such an ill-bred woman!{EOL}
045C={CHARNAME}We are not allowed to{LF}speak with the guests.{EOL}
045D={CHARNAME}We get to eat the leftovers{LF}after the banquet.{CLR}
045E={CHARNAME}It's our only pleasure{LF}in this job.{EOL}
045F={CHARNAME}A lot of leftovers in there?{LF}Oh, happy day!{EOL}
0460={CHARNAME}I'm full!{LF}Did you see that roast beef?{CLR}
0461={CHARNAME}I ate too much!  Never again!{LF}By the way, do you know when{LF}the next banquet is?{EOL}
0462={CHARNAME}Ulp!  I'm sorry!  I'm...{LF}Oh...who are you?{LF}I thought you were my boss!{CLR}
0463={CHARNAME}He's always scolding me...{EOL}
0464={CHARNAME}I'm just taking my break now.{EOL}
0465={CHARNAME}I've been on break since{LF}ten this morning!{LF}Heh heh heh...{EOL}
0466={CHARNAME}What?  The party's over?{LF}Ahhh....breaktime!!{EOL}
0467={CHARNAME}This stew must be{LF}extremely delicious!  It's{LF}been cooking for three days!{EOL}
0468={CHARNAME}Banquets are a good{LF}opportunity to show off{LF}my abilities as a cook!{EOL}
0469={CHARNAME}I was very disappointed{LF}to see that almost no one{LF}cleaned his plate!{CLR}
046A={CHARNAME}What happened in there?{EOL}
046B={CHARNAME}When is the duke{LF}coming back?  I have to{LF}plan his dinner menu.{EOL}
046C={CHARNAME}We're serving fried{LF}Gamoor lobsters and scallops!{LF}Seafood is{CLR}
046D={CHARNAME}one of the duke's favorites.{EOL}
046E={CHARNAME}How was dinner?{LF}The menu was really special,{LF}wasn't it?{CLR}
046F={CHARNAME}I wish I had gone to the{LF}banquet with you...What?{LF}You didn't eat!  How come?{EOL}
0470={CHARNAME}Mr. Zak eats only raw meat?{LF}I had no idea!...{EOL}
0471={CHARNAME}Did Mr. Zak like the{LF}fried lobsters?{EOL}
0472={CHARNAME}Have you looked around{LF}the castle?{EOL}
0473={CHARNAME}Mr. Nigel!  The party is{LF}ready now.  Would you please{LF}come to the banquet room?{EOL}
0474={CHARNAME}Please come to the{LF}banquet room.  It's on the{LF}second floor.{EOL}
0475={CHARNAME}You cannot leave{LF}just yet....{EOL}
0476={CHARNAME}Long ago, there was{LF}a huge war on the continent.{LF}King Nole used this island{CLR}
0477={CHARNAME}as a base.  When the war{LF}was over, the fortresses and{LF}labyrinths were simply{CLR}
0478={CHARNAME}abandoned...many of them{LF}stand to this day!{EOL}
0479={CHARNAME}The Dark Wizard of{LF}the tower is very cunning!{LF}The tower itself is like a{CLR}
047A={CHARNAME}storied maze.  There is{LF}also a barrier to protect the{LF}wizard from outsiders...{EOL}
047B={CHARNAME}I got a bonus today!{LF}Want to go to Greenpea's and{LF}watch me double it?{EOL}
047C={CHARNAME}Oh, I'm sorry!{LF}We thought you were one of our{LF}soldiers!  Did we scare you?{CLR}
047D={CHARNAME}We have to study{LF}new tactics everyday!{EOL}
047E={CHARNAME}The other soldiers are{LF}making the rounds outside.{EOL}
047F={CHARNAME}Everyone's out training.{LF}Me?  Well, uh...umm...{CLR}
0480={CHARNAME}I-I'm minding the store{LF}while they're gone!{EOL}
0481={CHARNAME}This is the newest formation!{LF}How do you like it?{EOL}
0482={CHARNAME}We modeled it after the{LF}movement of some monsters{LF}we saw in a cave.{EOL}
0483={CHARNAME}Don't interrupt!{LF}It's just training, but I still{LF}have to concentrate!{EOL}
0484={CHARNAME}Out of the way, kid!{LF}This is serious.  I've got{LF}60 golds riding on this fight!{EOL}
0485={CHARNAME}Sir Nigel, welcome to{LF}the castle.  Enjoy thy stay!{EOL}
0486={CHARNAME}I think the party{LF}is ready now.{CLR}
0487={CHARNAME}Why dost thou not go{LF}to the banquet room?{EOL}
0488={CHARNAME}Art thou really going to{LF}the tower?  'Tis a very{LF}dangerous place!{CLR}
0489={CHARNAME}Didst thou know there{LF}is a magic barrier at the{LF}entrance to the tower?{CLR}
048A={CHARNAME}My investigations revealed{LF}that an armlet is necessary{LF}to break the barrier{CLR}
048B={CHARNAME}'Tis somewhere in the{LF}underground crypt next to the{LF}church.  I keep sending{CLR}
048C={CHARNAME}my best scouts in there,{LF}but somehow they never{LF}seem to return...I think{CLR}
048D={CHARNAME}there must be traps or{LF}some such protecting the{LF}armlet.{EOL}
048E={CHARNAME}Sir Nigel!{LF}Get the armlet and{LF}defeat Mir for the Duke!{EOL}
048F={CHARNAME}Dexter and Zak came through{LF}here a little while ago.  They{LF}asked me how to break the{CLR}
0490={CHARNAME}barrier, and left for{LF}the crypt.  Sir Nigel,{LF}I must warn you that{CLR}
0491={CHARNAME}the monsters down there{LF}are very intelligent.  Perhaps{LF}Mir cast a spell on them.{CLR}
0492={CHARNAME}Remember- thou can'st{LF}find the armlet if thou dost{LF}rely on thy sword alone.{CLR}
0493={CHARNAME}Take care of thyself!{EOL}
0494={CHARNAME}...go...upstairs{LF}and... cut the... armor{EOL}
0495={CHARNAME}Nice to see thee again.{LF}As thou dost see, I'm{LF}completely healed now.{CLR}
0496={CHARNAME}I'll do my best to make{LF}Mercator a good home for its{LF}people.{CLR}
0497={CHARNAME}I've been thinking about{LF}the relationship between{LF}politics and the militia for{CLR}
0498={CHARNAME}a long time, now.  Julie{LF}and I have often discussed{LF}it, and I'm now convinced that{CLR}
0499={CHARNAME}I can make this town{LF}prosper without a{LF}military force!{CLR}
049A={CHARNAME}So, I built a casino in{LF}the town well to help lower{LF}the taxes.{CLR}
049B={CHARNAME}Please drop by{LF}if thou dost have the time.{CLR}
049C={CHARNAME}Visit me anytime!{LF}Take care of thyself!{EOL}
049D={CHARNAME}Hello again, Sir Nigel.{LF}Do you want this?{CLR}
049E={CHARNAME}This room is reserved{LF}for special guests.{EOL}
049F={CHARNAME}Hey!  How did you{LF}escape?!!  I'm not through{LF}with you yet!!{EOL}
04A0={CHARNAME}Arrrrgh!  All I wanted was{LF}a few, measly treasures!  Now{LF}We're dead broke!{CLR}
04A1={CHARNAME}This is another fine mess{LF}you've gotten me into!!{CLR}
04A2={CHARNAME}The way we could afford{LF}to go back to the continent{LF}was on the prison ship,{CLR}
04A3={CHARNAME}so I had them arrest me!{LF}But, phew!  What a stink!{LF}I can't stand it in here!{CLR}
04A4={CHARNAME}Stinky...slimy...YUK!!{LF}Jailor!{LF}Gimme a better room!!{EOL}
04A5={CHARNAME}I won't forget you{LF}for this, Nigel!!  I swear one{LF}day I'll pay you back!!{EOL}
04A6={CHARNAME}...burp!...{EOL}
04A7={CHARNAME}Give me those treasures!{EOL}
04A8={CHARNAME}Stiiiiinky...{EOL}
04A9={CHARNAME}...BURRRRP!!...{EOL}
04AA={CHARNAME}Slimeeeee...{EOL}
04AB={CHARNAME}All right, already!  Such{LF}superior swordsmanship...{LF}I was wrong, you convinced me!{CLR}
04AC={CHARNAME}Go ahead, take the treasures.{LF}They're all yours, if you'll{LF}just stop hitting me!{EOL}
04AD={CHARNAME}Wandering about in this{LF}basement has completely{LF}tired us out!  Please go on{CLR}
04AE={CHARNAME}ahead and save the princess.{LF}The duke has taken Miss Lara{LF}prisoner...please find her!{EOL}
04AF={CHARNAME}You came here just{LF}following his words...{LF}How innocent you are...!{EOL}
04B0={CHARNAME}My name is Old Gol.{LF}I'm the keeper of Greenmaze.{LF}My father was{CLR}
04B1={CHARNAME}once a keeper, too.{LF}What can I do for you?{CLR}
04B2={CHARNAME}{ITEM}, hmmmm...{LF}Yes, it's hidden in the depths{LF}of this forest, but...{CLR}
04B3={CHARNAME}The naughty little gnomes{LF}that live here have{LF}changed the routes{CLR}
04B4={CHARNAME}Do you need tips about{LF}walking in the woods?{YESNO}
04B5={CHARNAME}First, don't look at the{LF}bottom of the trees.  If{LF}you see a gap between{CLR}
04B6={CHARNAME}the tops of two lines of{LF}trees, it might be a route.{LF}If you get stuck there,{CLR}
04B7={CHARNAME}try jumping up.  There{LF}might be a hidden step or{LF}obstacle in front of you{CLR}
04B8={CHARNAME}Also, there are many{LF}underpasses.  Some are{LF}shortcuts, and some are not.{CLR}
04B9={CHARNAME}You should memorize the{LF}surroundings before going{LF}down the underpass.{CLR}
04BA={CHARNAME}The {ITEM} is in{LF}the northeast sector of{LF}this forest.{EOL}
04BB={CHARNAME}You've found the {ITEM}!{CLR}
04BC={CHARNAME}Perhaps you know this{LF}forest better than me!  Will{LF}you take my place?{EOL}
04BD={CHARNAME}Bow-wow{EOL}
04BE={CHARNAME}I shall never forget{LF}your kindness!{EOL}
04BF={CHARNAME}Hi, nice to meet you.{LF}I can't see you, but you look{LF}fine.  Something to eat?{CLR}
04C0={CHARNAME}I can't see you, but{LF}you look happy.  Visit me{LF}anytime you like.{CLR}
04C1={CHARNAME}I can't see you, but{LF}you look brave.{EOL}
04C2={CHARNAME}Good afternoon.{LF}Make yourself at home.{LF}Ho ho ho...{EOL}
04C3={CHARNAME}Arf!  Arf!{LF}Bow-wow-wow!{EOL}
04C4={CHARNAME}We cannot return to{LF}our original forms until that{LF}miserable witch is defeated.{EOL}
04C5={CHARNAME}Thanks again for{LF}all you've done!{EOL}
04C6={CHARNAME}I want to see Bell!{LF}I want to see Bell!{EOL}
04C7={CHARNAME}Are you a tourist?{LF}You'd better go back.  All{LF}the townspeople were{CLR}
04C8={CHARNAME}suddenly taken to the{LF}mountains by strange soldiers.{LF}I was fishing by the sea{CLR}
04C9={CHARNAME}at the time...{LF}All that's left are a priest{LF}and a sick old man...{EOL}
04CA={CHARNAME}I heard  you rescued{LF}the people of this town!{LF}Bravo!  Well done!{EOL}
04CB={CHARNAME}...cough...cough...{EOL}
04CC={CHARNAME}It's a miracle!  My health{LF}suddenly came back to see them{LF}all returned safe and sound!{EOL}
04CD={CHARNAME}Why did Duke Mercator{LF}take all the people away?..{EOL}
04CE={CHARNAME}I'm happy now that{LF}everything's back to normal...{EOL}
04CF={CHARNAME}Get the monster, please!{EOL}
04D0={CHARNAME}We're all from Verla.{LF}Duke Mercator forced us to{LF}dig this mine.{CLR}
04D1={CHARNAME}Our families were also{LF}taken captive by his{LF}soldiers...please save them!{CLR}
04D2={CHARNAME}This mine consists of three{LF}forked tunnels.  You'll find{CLR}
04D3={CHARNAME}our friends caught somewhere{LF}in the other two tunnels.{LF}Please help us!{EOL}
04D4={CHARNAME}Whew!  What a relief!{LF}No more digging!  Now I can{LF}go back to my old job.{EOL}
04D5={CHARNAME}EEEEEEK!!!{EOL}
04D6={CHARNAME}Duke Mercator suddenly{LF}appeared in town and{LF}ordered his henchmen{CLR}
04D7={CHARNAME}to bring us here.{LF}And I thought he was{LF}such a gentleman...{EOL}
04D8={CHARNAME}Why did Duke Mercator{LF}do such a terrible thing?{EOL}
04D9={CHARNAME}H-help!{LF}S-somebody help!!{EOL}
04DA={CHARNAME}I was so scared!{EOL}
04DB={CHARNAME}I shall never forget the{LF}fear I felt in the mines{LF}for as long as I live.{EOL}
04DC={CHARNAME}We're OK! Kill him!{EOL}
04DD={CHARNAME}What was the duke{LF}looking for in this{LF}mine, anyway?{CLR}
04DE={CHARNAME}He kept us digging{LF}morning, noon, and night!{EOL}
04DF={CHARNAME}The duke and his soldiers{LF}left for Destel.  The dwarves{LF}in that village are all{CLR}
04E0={CHARNAME}peaceful and good-natured.{LF}They have no weapons to{LF}protect themselves.{CLR}
04E1={CHARNAME}I'm afraid it'll be{LF}a slaughter...{EOL}
04E2={CHARNAME}Go!  GO!!....{EOL}
04E3={CHARNAME}What's Duke Mercator{LF}doing now...?{CLR}
04E4={CHARNAME}Nigel!  I really think{LF}you're the only guy{LF}who can defeat the duke!{EOL}
04E5={CHARNAME}Hold out!{EOL}
04E6={CHARNAME}The duke must have{LF}sold us out for the treasures.{EOL}
04E7={CHARNAME}I know the mayor of Destel.{LF}He comes here often to{LF}buy fish.  He's a good man.{CLR}
04E8={CHARNAME}He said they live{LF}peacefully there, growing{LF}lovely, scented flowers...{EOL}
04E9={CHARNAME}He'll kill us!!{EOL}
04EA={CHARNAME}There is a small village on{LF}the west side of this mine.{LF}I saw Duke Mercator marching{CLR}
04EB={CHARNAME}with his soldiers along{LF}the road that leads to{LF}the village.{CLR}
04EC={CHARNAME}Do you know anything{LF}about it?{LF}What's going on?{EOL}
04ED={CHARNAME}The tunnel between{LF}Mercator and Verla is{LF}finally open.{CLR}
04EE={CHARNAME}I can go to{LF}Greenpea's everyday!{CLR}
04EF={CHARNAME}Being kept in that dark and{LF}cramped tunnel for so long{LF}really stressed me out!{EOL}
04F0={CHARNAME}eeeeEEEEK!!!{EOL}
04F1={CHARNAME}Thank you very much.{LF}You looked so cool{LF}when you were fighting!{EOL}
04F2={CHARNAME}Don't look at ME...{LF}GET 'im!{EOL}
04F3={CHARNAME}I overheard the duke's men{LF}say the digging was over{LF}because they found{CLR}
04F4={CHARNAME}what they were looking for.{EOL}
04F5={CHARNAME}I found the sword, but{LF}I didn't tell the duke{LF}about it!{EOL}
04F6={CHARNAME}Dig!  Dig!{EOL}
04F7={CHARNAME}I had my suspicions{LF}all along that this was no{LF}ordinary mine.{CLR}
04F8={CHARNAME}But who would have{LF}guessed that a legendary{LF}treasure was hidden there!{EOL}
04F9={CHARNAME}I have to keep at it.{LF}Our lives are depending{LF}on this...{EOL}
04FA={CHARNAME}That tunnel in the mine{LF}is the only way{LF}to go to Destel.{CLR}
04FB={CHARNAME}The sword?  We happened{LF}to find it when we were{LF}digging the tunnel.{EOL}
04FC={CHARNAME}I can't trust humans{LF}anymore!{EOL}
04FD={CHARNAME}My house was ransacked{LF}by many big soldiers!!...{EOL}
04FE={CHARNAME}Why are humans so rude?!{LF}They came from out of nowhere{LF}and trampled down our{CLR}
04FF={CHARNAME}flower beds...{LF}If they wanted the jewel,{LF}they should have asked me...{CLR}
0500={CHARNAME}Jewel?  someone named{LF}Mercator found it and{LF}took it away.{CLR}
0501={CHARNAME}Why does he want such a{LF}worthless thing?  Flowers and{LF}seeds are prettier...and they{CLR}
0502={CHARNAME}smell good, too!{EOL}
0503={CHARNAME}I was at the inn, talking{LF}about the ancient cave under{LF}this village, when some{CLR}
0504={CHARNAME}tourist suddenly rushed down{LF}here, broke the seal, and{LF}disappeared down the cave...{EOL}
0505={CHARNAME}I've never seen such{LF}rudeness in all my life!{EOL}
0506={CHARNAME}I don't like the hectic{LF}pace of life in crowded towns,{LF}so I live here quietly{CLR}
0507={CHARNAME}with the dwarves.{CLR}
0508={CHARNAME}I think humans are wicked.{EOL}
0509={CHARNAME}Once I went down and{LF}tried to look into the cave,{LF}but it was impossible.{CLR}
050A={CHARNAME}I don't think you can do it.{EOL}
050B={CHARNAME}We just want to live{LF}in peace...{EOL}
050C={CHARNAME}Dwarves are quite pious.{EOL}
050D={CHARNAME}I was scared!{LF}The soldiers were{LF}twice as tall as me!{EOL}
050E={CHARNAME}Kindly's Item Shop!{CLR}
050F={CHARNAME}I'm kind!{LF}My brother is not...{EOL}
0510={CHARNAME}Welcome to the{LF}village of Destel.{EOL}
0511={CHARNAME}This well is the entrance{LF}to an ancient cave where{LF}monsters dwell.{EOL}
0512={CHARNAME}Sometimes, late at night{LF}you can hear something{LF}roaring in this well...{EOL}
0513={CHARNAME}My flowerbed was{LF}ruined.....{LF}What were they looking for?{CLR}
0514={CHARNAME}I don't think I have{LF}anything they'd want.{EOL}
0515={CHARNAME}Big, hulking soldiers rushed{LF}into my house and demanded{LF}to know where the jewel was!{CLR}
0516={CHARNAME}What were they talking{LF}about?  I have nothing{LF}but flower seeds.{EOL}
0517={CHARNAME}Duke Mercator suddenly{LF}appeared and bought every{LF}last raft I had!{CLR}
0518={CHARNAME}He paid me a whole{LF}6 golds for them!  He said{LF}he was going to the shrine.{EOL}
0519={CHARNAME}Sorry!  All sold out...{LF}You can still get to the{LF}shrine through the cave under{CLR}
051A={CHARNAME}Destel, but...{LF}it's pretty dangerous.{EOL}
051B={CHARNAME}Beautiful waterfall, huh?{LF}The people of Destel take good{LF}care to keep the water clean.{EOL}
051C={CHARNAME}I make a good living here{LF}off the treasure hunters{LF}who visit this lake.{EOL}
051D={CHARNAME}Hi, stranger.  You are{LF}the first visitor we've had{LF}in 300 years.{CLR}
051E={CHARNAME}Wh-what?  Another{LF}dictator has risen to power{LF}on the surface?{EOL}
051F={CHARNAME}King Nole gave us eternal{LF}youth in reward for building{LF}his underground palace.{CLR}
0520={CHARNAME}I like the calm life here.{LF}I don't want to go back{LF}to the surface...{EOL}
0521={CHARNAME}You have to go through{LF}a huge and complex labyrinth{LF}to get to the palace.{CLR}
0522={CHARNAME}The maze was designed{LF}by King Nole himself.{CLR}
0523={CHARNAME}It's impossible even{LF}for us to go through.{CLR}
0524={CHARNAME}What a greedy man he was!{EOL}
0525={CHARNAME}There is no priest here,{LF}but I've meditated on{LF}the goddess for 300 years,{CLR}
0526={CHARNAME}so I am the substitute.{EOL}
0527={CHARNAME}I worked for King Nole{LF}so I could have eternal life.{CLR}
0528={CHARNAME}But now I just idle my{LF}time away{DELAY_LONG}...{DELAY_LONG}...{DELAY_LONG}sigh!...{CLR}
0529={CHARNAME}Got any comic books?{EOL}
052A={CHARNAME}There are three monsters{LF}in the labyrinth called{LF}"Gehenna's Gatekeepers."{CLR}
052B={CHARNAME}You have to defeat them{LF}to open the gateway{LF}to the palace.{EOL}
052C={CHARNAME}Hi!  The original owner of{LF}this shop left one day 200{LF}years ago and never returned.{EOL}
052D={CHARNAME}Now, let's start{LF}our adventure!!{EOL}
052E={CHARNAME}Omigosh...a MAN!!{EOL}
052F={CHARNAME}I have to tell{LF}Grampa!{EOL}

0531={CHARNAME}He's still sleeping...{LF}He didn't seem to be{LF}the lazy type.....{EOL}
0532={CHARNAME}Let him sleep for a while.{LF}You can stay in our village{LF}as long as you want.{CLR}
0533={CHARNAME}Hurray!{LF}That's a great idea!{CLR}
0534={CHARNAME}But we're in a hurry.{LF}Nigel!  WAKE UP!!  It's time to{LF}{DELAY_SHORT}continue our treasure hunt!{EOL}
0535={CHARNAME}Hi!  Are you OK now?{LF}...well...{DELAY_SHORT}Where is your friend?{LF}Y'know, that mini-sized girl.{EOL}
0536={CHARNAME}How dare you call me{LF}"mini-sized"!!{LF}You hairy brute!{EOL}
