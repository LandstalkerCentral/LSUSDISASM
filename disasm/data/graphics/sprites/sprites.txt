Technical Info
--------------

The graphics data starts off at offset 0x120000, which provides the offset to
the animations pointer table. After this ponter, there is a table of words that
provide relative offsets to the animation pointer table. Each offset represents
one sprite. 

The animations pointer table has pointers each leading to rows in the frame
pointer table. The frame pointer table has pointers leading to each individual
frame of a sprite animation.

Well done if you followed all of that. It is rather amusing to note that
$120000 is a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to the image of
Nigel standing with his back turned to the camera.

The graphical data starts off with a 2 byte header:
 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 ^ <-------> <->   ^ <-------> <->
 0     y      w    e     x      h

y = y-coordinate  (pixels/2 )
x = x-coordinate  (pixels/2 )
w = sprite width  (tiles - 1)
h = sprite height (tiles - 1)
e = end of header

If the e bit is clear, it means that there is an additional header, describing
an additional sprite. This can go on for multiple sprites. Most sprites in the
game are made up of composite sprites set up to make one big image.

After the sprite header, there is a 2 byte graphical data header:
 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_| |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 ^ ^ ^ <------------------------->
 F E C    size of data in words

F = fill tiledata with [size] words of $0000
E = end of graphical data.
C = following data is RLE-compressed. Uncompressed data = [size] words

if F or C is not set, then the data immediately following is raw bitmap pixels
for the following [size] words.

If E is not set then there is another block of graphical information preceded by
the same header as above immediately following the raw data.
